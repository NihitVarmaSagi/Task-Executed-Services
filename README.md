# Task-Executed-Services

The task executed services maintains a pool of threads to execute tasks assigned by the task executer client by implementing a blocking fifo.
Both blocking fifo and array blocking fifo .java files have been uploaded where one was implemented using monitors and the other by using the in-built package. We can use any one of these to implement our project
